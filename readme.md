# Stringer

_A starter kit for new web projects, incorporating the jQuery mmenu system_

Demo: [stringer.elmnt.com](http://stringer.elmnt.com "stringer.elmnt.com")

This is both a workable boilerplate that I use to kick off new web projects, and an always-under-construction sandbox.

### Some helpful notes:
- I use Codekit to manage this project, so I've included my config file in the repo.
- The [mmenu](http://mmenu.frebsite.nl "mmenu") system is very flexible, and loaded with options. I've included a few additional files to show left vs. right alignment, and to demonstrate the overall structure your site/app should maintain for it to work.
- I'm using an apache .shtml file format for includes, as per the practice at my agency, but you could easily convert to the template style of your own choosing. 
- See the style guide for some basic markup elements.

### Changelog

I'm adding a changelog with this push, which I'm labeling v2.0, as I've made some major changes. I have a lot more on my to-do list, and I'd like to keep a better record as it grows.

#### v2.0
- Reformatted my Sass partials
- Rebuilt the grid system
- Removed some fluff to decrease weight and increase performance

A stringer is a wooden strip that runs the length of a surfboard, designed to give the board strength &amp; rigidity.
